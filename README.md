# Snippets

Code examples, mostly related to the `Node.js` & `React`. Heavily focuses on `MongoDB` as well.

Basically, a collection of tutorials and examples I have covered, sometimes with my own edits. Check the `README` files
for more details in each directory and project.

Comments are included in each file to demonstrate how I went about testing and learning the code.
